1. Introduction
----------------

Before installing the mod, PLEASE read the installation section.

This mod provides a friendship path for Xan NPC in Baldur's Gate I.

This mod is Tutu-compatible and BGT-compatible. You can also install the mod
on Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast, 
Baldur's Gate: The Original Saga, and Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.

Xan, a non-player character from the first game in Baldur's Gate series, is a depressed elven mage - enchanter. Notable quotes: "We're all doomed."
"Life is so hollow." "It is hardly worth the effort of trying."
"What is the point?" "Our quest is vain." "Onward, to futility!"

----------------
2. Installation
----------------

Make sure that Baldur's Gate or ANY game-related utilities are not running,
and that you are installing the mod into the correct directory.

Before installing any mods, it is recommended to backup your chitin.key,
baldur.exe, your entire override directory and your dialog.tlk
(in case of BG:EE, lang directory).

Unpack XanBG1Friend_v9.zip into your Baldur's Gate directory.

TO INSTALL, UNINSTALL OR REINSTALL THE MOD, run setup-xanbg1friend.exe.

For Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition players: you need to install the mod
in the same folder as your chitin.key file.

-----------------------
3. General Information
-----------------------

Xan's friendship path consists of sixteen sequential dialogues and four
chapter-related talks in chapters 4,5,6 and 7. All talks are Xan-initiated.

The talks trigger if Xan is in party, and the protagonist is either not
eligible for a romance with Xan, or the romance is not active. 

This means that you will still get the friendship path, if your Xan romance
has ended. Exception: if the romance was ended after it has become
committed.

If you do not wish to talk, some banters are skipped. Every banter has a
"I don't want to talk right now"-like option.
